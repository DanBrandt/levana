# levana
An empirical space weather model for the lunar surface. The model contains several modules that provide estimates of 
important space weather parameters at any location on the lunar surface. These parameters include Galactic Cosmic Ray 
flux, solar energetic particle flux, solar extreme ultraviolet irradiance (EUV), and solar wind speed and pressure.

### Etymological Note

The word 'Levana' (לְבָנָה) is Hebrew for 'Moon', used in reference to the Rosh Chodesh (ראש חודש) ceremony inaugurating 
the birth of a New Moon each month, with origins in the divinely-sanctioned ceremony instituted in Numbers 10:10, and 
commemorated in apostolic Christianity by way of the Feast of the Annunciation, per St. Thomas Aquinas 
(ST I-II.103.3.ad 4).
